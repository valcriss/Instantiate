# Introduction

Instantiate automatically provisions disposable environments for every merge request. 
It listens to your GitHub or GitLab events, renders the configuration templates stored in the repository and deploys the stack using your favorite orchestrator.

These environments run on dynamic ports and are destroyed once the merge request is closed, allowing reviewers to test features in isolation without any manual setup.
