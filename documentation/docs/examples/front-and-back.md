# Examples - Front and Back

This example consists of a minimal frontend and backend setup. The frontend performs a basic API call to the backend to illustrate service communication. The purpose of this project is to showcase how to structure and write configuration files required by Instantiate to deploy and link multiple services.
The main configuration files can be found in the .instantiate directory of the frontend repository.
